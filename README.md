The Lung Health Analyzer is a machine learning-powered tool that predicts respiratory conditions based on user-inputted health parameters such as age, smoking status, cough frequency, shortness of breath, fever presence, blood oxygen saturation, and lung capacity. Using a Random Forest Classifier,Gradient boosting classifier the model processes inputs, encodes categorical values, and provides an instant diagnosis with a confidence score. Built with Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, and Gradio, this interactive web application offers real-time predictions, making it useful for medical pre-screening, remote health monitoring, and research purposes.
